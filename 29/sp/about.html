    ‚ÄúCount your age by new thought, not years. Count your life by smiles, not tears.
    As thought came alive, it stole a glance from under the eyelids. It asked words to set it free. A voice it can embrace and sway with glee. But this thought is a thought, just a thought.Like fragrance floating in the breeze.A fragrance that is unspeaking.You live with it.I'm aware of it.Out in the open for the work to see.What is this unknown mystery?‚Äù<br>    ‚Äì Pandith
